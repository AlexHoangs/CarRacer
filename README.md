# CarRacer
This program generates a gui that consists of the implemented game, CarRacer, using PyGame. The player races against the PC for up to 10 levels of difficulty. This program was inspired by TechForTim as a great learning experience with a change in how the player can race against the PC. The player has the ability to activate endless amounds of NOS, a nitrous oxide engine, that increases the speed of the car to its maxixmum potential. However, with great power comes with great responsibility. Rather than bouncing off of walls after hitting the borders, the car will crash into it when racing at maximum speed using NOS, rendering the car the inability to get back into the track. Ultimately causing the PC to win.
